super:
  description: |
    Version one of a small superposition prover
    written in Lean. This repository introduces
    a tactic `super` which attempts to solve 
    problems in first order logic, possibly 
    given a list of extra hypotheses.

    This version is not compatible with community
    releases of Lean.

mathematica:
  description: |
    Connects Lean to the computer algebra system
    Mathematica. This project offers a 
    bi-directional translation between the two
    systems. From within Lean, you can evaluate
    Mathematica commands, possibly including
    translated Lean expressions, and process
    the results. From Mathematica, you can access
    a Lean environment.

    Examples of calling Mathematica from Lean
    can be found at 
    [robertylewis/mathematica_examples](https://github.com/robertylewis/mathematica_examples),
    and examples in the other direction at 
    [minchaowu/mm-lean](https://github.com/minchaowu/mm-lean).
    These repositories are not in the contrib list
    because they depend on Mathematica, which 
    is proprietary software.

lean-perfectoid-spaces: 
  description: |
    Perfectoid spaces are sophisticated objects in arithmetic geometry 
    introduced by Peter Scholze in 2012. We formalised enough definitions 
    and theorems in topology, algebra and geometry to define perfectoid 
    spaces in Lean. See also our
    [project webpage](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-perfectoid-spaces/)
    and [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12320).

sudoku:
  description: |
    This is an implementation of sudoku, written in Lean. When you open a
    level in VS Code, a sudoku board is displayed in the goal view. You can
    put numbers (and also pencil marks) on the board by adding hypotheses,
    but you have to prove that the placement of the number follows logically
    from what is already on the board! There are some tactics to help you with
    this, and you can also prove theorems to build up your personal library of
    sudoku theory.

lftcm2020:
  description: |
    This repository contains tutorials about Lean and mathlib that were developed
    for the workshop [Lean for the Curious Mathematician](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lftcm2020/),
    held in July 2020. The tutorials range from introductory lessons on numbers,
    logic, and sets to advanced lessons on category theory and manifolds.
    In addition to the materials found in this repository, we recommend watching
    the [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlF-CfQhukNlxexiNJErGJd2dte_J1t1N)
    of the tutorials and lectures from the workshop.
